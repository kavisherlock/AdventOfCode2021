This was definitely a tricky one, but I also had a few tricks up my sleeve that helped me solve it.
For part 1, I had to find all the low points from all four sides. So I just surrounded the entire map in 9s. That way, I didn't have to worry about the edges or corners and was able to do simple addition of all low points.
For part 2, initially, finding the basin seemed like a daunting task. But then I brought back our old friend recursion. The size of a basin at a point is essentially the sum of size of the basin at all of its neighbors plus one (for the point itself). So I just recursively called the function on all of the neighbors. THe only thing I had to keep in mind was not counting the same point twice if it was a neighbor of two different points. And the answer presented itself
