The idea of recursion seemed quite obvious from the start for this problem, since we were trying to find the number of paths from a starting node to an end one, and the number of paths from one node is always the sum of the number of paths from its neighboring nodes.
The only tricky part was implementing it given the problem's parameters, i.e, certain caves can be visited only once, and others multiple times. I was able to keep track of this by passing around a "visited" string-boolean map for each cave, for each path in the recursion. And essentially, it performed a DFS after that
For part two of the problem, I needed to only make a slight modification to the original recursive logic, to count the number of visits, instead of a boolean. And find the paths for each small cave being visited twice. The only tricky bit was at the end, where I needed to subtract the paths where no caves were being visited twice, since those paths were being counted for every iteration for a small cave being visited twice.
