Whenever a problem with coordiates comes up, the first decision is always about how to represent them. Should it be with a 2D array or an array of the marked coordinates? I typically choose the latter approach when all that matters are the marked coordinates and that is what I did here
For part 1, we just had to do one fold accross the grid. For this, all I needed to do was move all the marked coordinates below/right of the fold line up by twice the value of the x/y coordiate of the fold line respectively. The only thing to keep in mind was duplicates, which I got rid of by using the set and map functions.
For part 2, doing the rest of the folds was easy enough. And at the end, I ended up using the 2D array anyway, since I had to print out the grid, but of course, after all the folds, it was a much smaller grid. And the answer was staring at me.
