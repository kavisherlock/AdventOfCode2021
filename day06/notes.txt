I knew the problem is not gonna be as straightforward as part 1 made it appear. But even so, for part 1, I went with the simple array implementation, maintaining an array of fish and decrementing over each iteration, making a new array. Definitely inefficient, but quick and worked
As soon as I realised part one took about 3 or 4 seconds, I knew part two was gonna be, "now do it over a million iteration". Turns out, 256 was large enough. Took me a second, but I realised that, because the contents of the list are just numbers from 0 to 8, and all that matters is the counts of each, I can just store them in a 'fish_count' array, and just maintain how many of each fish there are, and each iteration, update their counts. And it worked like a charm
